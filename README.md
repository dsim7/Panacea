# Panacea
Unity game made for practice.

You are the doctor in charge of a camp in a post apocalyptic world at war. You job is to bring your patients back to health, or at least prevent as many from dying as possible.

# Instructions
Double click on a patient to start tending to their injuries. Tending a patient repeatedly makes it more effective.

Select a patient and click on one of the abilities in the ability bar to use it on them.

A patient with antibiotics will receive a large boost in resilience for 1 minute. You have limited uses of these.

A patient with pain killers will not take any damage for 1 minute. You have limited uses of these.

Assign a nurse to a patient for them to be healed periodically. You may have 3 nurses assigned at a time, assigning a fourth will reassign the first.

# Bars
The light green portion of a patient's health bar is their health. If this reaches 100%, they are healed, if it reaches 0, they die. The dark green portion is their current maximum which will slowly increase over time as you tend to them; they cannot be healed beyond this amount.

Patients will take damage over time based on their Condition. The worse condition they are in, the more damage they take. Their condition also worsens over time. Tending to them improves their condition.

Patients' resilience is a measure of how effective your treatments are on them; higher resilience patient are more easily healed.

# End of the Day
There are three populations in the camp and the patients you treat will fall into one of them: the Soldiers, the Scavengers, the Scientists.

At the end of the day, the activities of each population will be reported to you. The success of their activities is dependent on how strong the population is. Saving patients from a certain population strengthens that population while letting patients die weakens their population.

The activities of the soldiers determine how severe the injuries of the next batch of patients are.

The activities of the scavengers determine how well your antibiotics and pain killers are restocked.

The activities of the scientists lead to progress in their research. Once a research project is completed, you will have a large boost in healing effectiveness for one day. And then they will begin a project.
