  eventDescriptions:
  - Scouts had discovered an unguarded cache of valuable supplies in a remote area.
  - A patrol found a camp which had been overwhelmed and potentially still held supplies.
  - A supply run was planned to the nearby abandonned town.
  - A supply run into the city was planned. Hospitals, grocery stores, and hardware
    stores were prioritized.
  - A group of scavengers ventured into the woods to gather materials and resources.
  - The military had recently cleared a nearby town. The town's supplies were ripe
    for picking.
  successDescriptions:
  - Our scavengers were barely able to secure resources enough to sustain the camp
    for the day.
  - Our scavengers managed to find a few useful resources but nothing substantial.
  - Our scavengers gathered a healthy amount of resources to sustain the camp.
  - Thanks to the scavenger's strength in numbers, the run was exceptionally bountiful.
